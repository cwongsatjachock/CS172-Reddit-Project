He is a representative of the ruling Hungarian Christian democratic party, explicitly calling themselves an \"illiberal democracy\". The same party that people like Steve Bannon used as a model of how right-wing populism could defeat liberals. \n\nFor example, this is the same party that actually first [built a wall \\(or rather a fence\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_border_barrier) in Europe to prevent illegal immigrants from entering the country.\n\nThis is the same party that transformed state media to serve the party and broadcast pro-government propaganda. The same party that through private investors and oligarchs bought out most media outlets within the country effectively making it impossible for Hungarians to inform themselves impartially and as result, these events about the MEP are not broadcasted practically anywhere. If you ever wondered what Trump's presidency would look like in the future, how democracy and its institutions can be slowly destroyed, just look at Hungary."

Yes, this includes Philadelphia, where the Trump Campaign had to [admit in court that they had observers in the room.](https://twitter.com/alanfeuer/status/1324484846857658368)\n\n* Mail-in ballots are legal votes.

I put down my phone pretty early on as I wanted to clap as much as possible -- anyway, a video from my perspective would just be hearing me hollering like an idiot. Big shout out to the pot banging family on the other side of Broadway who waved back and danced with us! Lastly, for those who cannot celebrate out in the streets for whatever reason, you're welcome to the party in this thread. I have family in law that are in a similar situation so they've mostly plopped down with a big fry up breakfast!\n\nThird Edit: Thank you very much for my first reddit awards. I'd give the spiel about money being better used elsewhere but I am going to pretend that these are the free gifts that reddit keeps trying to hook people with. Big shout out to u/leaveittobever who came in clutch with the video from Chicago! It's basically what my experience was but with a better view and less pots and pans. Can't thank everyone enough for all the wonderful replies about their cities -- a nice reminder of what social media was supposed to and can still be. Y'all have made my day twice as nice"

Whichever party has control over the Senate puts in place a 'Majority leader' and with Mitch McConnell as the senate majority leader, he has had control over what the Senate chooses to vote on and he has ABUSED that power to no end. He tabled almost every Corona Relief stimulus bill that the House(democrat controlled) passed and refuses to take other very critical bills to vote on in the Senate. This goes back to the Obama administration. McConnell was crucial in rushing the appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett through the senate confirmation, while a corona relief bill sat on his desk, which is still sitting there because Trump told him not to vote on it before the election."

All my life, though, I've been coming back to Physics and Math, doing some sporadic reading, wishing I could pursue either field seriously, because it always felt like they were fundamental to everything we see around us, and the universe in general. I never got around to doing anything about it, but this man is one of the big reasons I kept coming back. Just last night, some kind of spark was reignited for some reason, and I went back to a lot of old theory - rifling through my school textbooks, just enjoying the feeling of learning. I stayed up all night going from one resource to another, and the rabbit hole took me to Sabrina Pasterski and then [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09175.pdf) paper. I can't believe that just a few hours after that, the man who wrote it is gone.\n\nI'm not even sure why I'm rambling on. I'm in shock, and I guess I'm trying to say that I promise to never ignore my longing to learn science again. I will pursue it, if nothing else, to honor this great man. He gave his life to it, and gave us so much. With both my spirit and flesh willing, it's a crime to not commit. If you've actually read this far, I apologize for going on and on, but I promise you, whoever you are, that I'm going to try. And I will keep coming back to this post, this thread, and this great, great man's life whenever I wander away from this promise. I hope that one day, I can say with pride that Stephen Hawking inspired my scientific journey.\n\nRest in peace, sir. We will never let your name or your unmeasurable work and impact be forgotten. "
